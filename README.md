# Plantify ðŸŒ±

Plantify is a mobile app that helps users manage and take care of their plants. Users can add their plants to the app, receive watering reminders, and identify unknown plants using the built-in plant identification feature. Implemented real-time image recognition, allowing users to build and manage a personal plant database with full CRUD functionality, including profile management and image uploads.

**Important:** This repository is a new public one created due to security problems in the initial private repository. All the project files have been moved to this repository.
